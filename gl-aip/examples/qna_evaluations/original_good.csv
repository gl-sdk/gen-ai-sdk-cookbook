Description: This table captures full-yacht pricing for itineraries that are available for private charter. It provides the all-inclusive cost of renting the entire vessel for a given trip. It is critical for queries about private bookings, high-end revenue opportunities, and comparing charter versus shared trip economics. Please take a note a trip with the same name may be offered as a shared or private trip but it usually has a different date. It is also common that if you want a private trip, you must contact the admin first. So there will be quite a lot of data without private charter information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The information that can be obtained includes the total number of yachts that started their trips from there, the number of itineraries, the value of (min, max, avg, and mode) for day_trip yachts and boat_capacity. There is also the average total_distance if the trip started from that location. Information regarding tickets include the total number of itinerary tickets offered, the total number of tickets remaining, total tickets sold, and the value of (min, max, and average) yacht price and the time required until tickets are sold out meaning equal to 0 or the offer period expires, calculated from the first day the tickets were offered. |
| public        | itinerary                | table             | Display name: Trip. Description: This table represents the travel plan or route offered by a yacht. It links each vessel to its trip schedule, including start dates, duration, embarkation and disembarkation ports, and capacity status. It enables the agent to answer questions about when and where yachts are sailing, how long trips last, and whether they are charter-only or open to shared bookings. It also provides seasonal and availability signals, which are essential for forecasting demand and revenue. Note: each ship has its own itinerary. Itineraries with the same name may have different departure times, and these are considered separate trips.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Description: This table captures full-yacht pricing for itineraries that are available for private charter. It provides the all-inclusive cost of renting the entire vessel for a given trip. It is critical for queries about private bookings, high-end revenue opportunities, and comparing charter versus shared trip economics. Please take a note a trip with the same name may be offered as a shared or private trip but it usually has a different date. It is also common that if you want a private trip, you must contact the admin first. So there will be quite a lot of data without private charter information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

There is also the average total_distance if the trip started from that location. Information regarding tickets include the total number of itinerary tickets offered, the total number of tickets remaining, total tickets sold, and the value of (min, max, and average) yacht price and the time required until tickets are sold out meaning equal to 0 or the offer period expires, calculated from the first day the tickets were offered. |
| public        | itinerary                | table             | Display name: Trip. Description: This table represents the travel plan or route offered by a yacht. It links each vessel to its trip schedule, including start dates, duration, embarkation and disembarkation ports, and capacity status. It enables the agent to answer questions about when and where yachts are sailing, how long trips last, and whether they are charter-only or open to shared bookings. It also provides seasonal and availability signals, which are essential for forecasting demand and revenue. Note: each ship has its own itinerary. Itineraries with the same name may have different departure times, and these are considered separate trips.                                                                                                                                                                                               |

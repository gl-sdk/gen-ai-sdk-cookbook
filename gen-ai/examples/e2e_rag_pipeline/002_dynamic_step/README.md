## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Please refer to prerequisites [here](../../../README.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository & open the directory**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GDP-ADMIN/gl-sdk-cookbook.git
   cd gl-sdk-cookbook/gen-ai/examples/build_e2e_rag_pipeline/your_first_rag_pipeline
   ```

2. **Set UV authentication**  
   Since UV will need to be able to access our private registry to download the required packages, please also set the following environment variables:
    ```env
    UV_INDEX_GEN_AI_INTERNAL_USERNAME=oauth2accesstoken
    UV_INDEX_GEN_AI_INTERNAL_PASSWORD="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)"
    ```

3. **Install dependency via UV**
    ```bash
    uv lock
    uv sync
    ```

4. **Prepare `.env` file**  
    Create a file called `.env`, then set the OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
    EMBEDDING_MODEL="text-embedding-3-small"
    LANGUAGE_MODEL="openai/gpt-5-nano"
    ```

5. **Index the dataset**

   ```bash
   uv run indexer.py
   ```

5. **Run the example**

   ```bash
   uv run pipeline.py
   ```

6. **Expected Output**

   When `use_knowledge_base` is set to `True`, you should see a response similar to the following:

   Pipeline result: I don’t have your dataset here. If you share the dataset or its structure (column names and a few rows), I can return the nocturnal creatures. In the meantime, here are quick ways to filter for nocturnal animals in common formats.

   Key idea
   - Look for a field that indicates activity period, e.g., activity_period or nocturnal (boolean).
   - If there isn’t a flag, infer nocturnal from values like night/nighttime/overnight in the activity_period.

   Python (pandas)
   - Using a boolean flag:
   nocturnal_df = df[df['nocturnal'].astype(bool)]
   - Inferring from activity_period:
   mask = df['activity_period'].astype(str).str.contains(r'night|overnight|nocturnal', case=False, na=False)
   nocturnal_df = df[mask]

   SQL
   SELECT * FROM dataset
   WHERE nocturnal = TRUE
      OR LOWER(activity_period) LIKE '%night%'
      OR LOWER(activity_period) LIKE '%overnight%';

   Excel/Sheets
   - If you have activity_period:
   Use a filter with criteria that contains night/overnight/nocturnal.
   - Or add a helper column:
   =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("night", A2)),"Yes","No")
   Filter where helper column = Yes.

   If you can paste:
   - The dataset (or a small sample), or
   - The exact column names (e.g., which column indicates nocturnal activity),

   I’ll generate the nocturnal subset for you.
